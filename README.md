## why

Aren't there already many space invaders emulators out there? Yup. Are they 
better than this one? Probably

I didn't really intend on creating an emulator for space invaders, I was 
helping someone in the /r/emudev slack (now the [/r/emudev discord](https://discord.gg/dkmJAes))
with questions that they had about the Intel 8080.

That turned into implementing parts of the i8080, which then turned into this.
